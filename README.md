## Design

    The whole application is done with HTML5 and CSS3

    **NOTE**
    Visual aesthetics was not the priority here, so feel free to redesign for your personal pleasure!

## Core

    I decided to make this application just using server side language and keep it as clean and simple 
    as possible without getting javascript in the mix.

    - PHP 5.3
    - HTML5
    - CSS3

## Extra functionality

    - None at this point
    - No JavaScript has been used in this version.
